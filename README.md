# 6mA_evolution
 Materials and scripts for 6mA evolution manuscript "". 
 
 The data and code used for the evolution of 6mA in eukaryotes project is structured in 4 folders:

## AMT_phylogeny
 This folder contains the original fasta files, alignments and IQ-TREE2 phylogeny for the MT-A70 family across eukaryotes.
 
## RepeatMaskerFiles
 This folder contains the RepeatModeler2 repeat libraries and RepeatMasker gff files generated for this study for several eukaryotes. 
 
## RNAseq_abundance_files
 This folder contains the Stringtie transcript abundance outputs for publicly available RNA-seq datasets re-analysed in this study. 
 
## Scripts
 This folder contains the scripts used to call modified bases with Nanopore data, and the analysis of these methylomes in R.

## Genomes
 
The new assemblies generated for *Naegleria gruberi* and *Chromosphaera perkinsii* used in this study, with annotation files.
